# Multiclass-Image-Classifier
Multiclass Image Classification of 7 different classes using transfer learning with pretrained models.

# Dataset:
Kaggle Dataset Link - [Multi-Class Image Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snehamahata/image-classification-dataset)

This Dataset has images of 7 different classes -
1. Bus
2. Car
3. Cat
4. Cricket
5. Dog
6. Football
7. Product 

# Approach:
I've used 4 different CNN models to train these images - 
1. CNN model bulit from scratch
2. Hypertuned CNN model bulit from scratch
3. Pretrained model VGG-16
4. Pretrained model Inception-V3

**I've used Transfer Learning to train these pretrained models, VGG-16 and Inception-V3, on a custom dataset. These 2 models have the best accuracy and f1-score.**
